# 3D Modelling and Printing Project

<h2>Star and Heart Charms</h2>

<p>
  Created in TEKX 101 - Introduction to 3D Printing and Laser Scanning Technologies at SFU, <b>Sept - Dec 2023</b>
</p>
<p>The charms were designed and modelled in Fusion360 before being sliced using UltiMaker Cura. After printing the charms, I carried out post-processing techniques like careful support structure removal and sanding. </p>
